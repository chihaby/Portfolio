                <h3 class="text-secondary">BIO</h3>
                <p>I'm a front-end developer who is passionate about Javascript, building great user experiences,
                    fighting for simplicity over complexity, constantly learning and curious.<br />
                    I've developed with a number of frameworks, such as AngularJS, JQuery along with
                    some ReactJS and its virtual-dom relatives. I enjoy learning new frameworks, libraries and
                    programming philosophies.<br />
                </p>
                <h3 class="text-secondary">Non-Technical Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    Outside of learning about the web, I have a number of other interests as well.
                    I play guitar, flamenco to be precise. I have two guitar albums out: one named "Azure" by
                    Mediterranean Nights, and one titled "Tales" by Oceo. Other passions aside from the music is
                    cycling,
                    beach activities, and enjoying nature in general.<br />
                </p>
